alright let. me set the stage. im building a bot for my aerospace class discord to practice tests together, as the faculty makes old tests available for self-study. im low bandwidth so i wanna whip up something quick and dirty.

all python stack, and basically just a shell to run API calls to the new openai vision api, which processes images and spits out a sick response with gpt-4. Users should @mention the bot with an image and a text input, thatâ€™s then sent to the api, which fetches response and outpuyts it. boom easy peasy.
